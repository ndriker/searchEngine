# Tokens: all alphanumeric sequences in the dataset.

# Stop words: do not use stopping while indexing, i.e. use all words, even the frequently occurring ones.
# Stemming: use stemming for better textual matches. Suggestion: Porter stemming, but it is up to you to choose.
# Important text: text in bold (b, strong), in headings (h1, h2, h3), and in titles should be treated as more important than the in other places.
# Verify which are the relevant HTML tags to select the important words
